Automation of patient feedback to reduce patient re-admissions 

## Introduction
We found out that in United States, re-admission of patients cost the hospitals about $17 billions annually. Our project attempts to reduce these costs and patient inconvenience by carrying out 3 tasks:

Analyzing the patient health to aid doctors in predicting their ailment using their symptoms and history.
Based on their diagnosis, we determine risk factor of patient re-admission in future. This database will help hospitals from incurring readmission fees if the patient has high risk-score.
Using UiPath's RPA, we carry out regular follow-ups with the high risk patients to further improve patient interaction.
